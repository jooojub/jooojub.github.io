Let's take a look at <mark>__builtin_alloca</mark>, one of the gcc builtins.

The first thing to keep in mind is that many books and posts advise against using <mark>alloca</mark> built-in' from a `security standpoint`.

I hope that through this post, you can clearly understand why.

If you've looked at open-source code a lot, you'll often see <mark>__builtin_alloca</mark>.

For example, glibc's `strdupa` macro is defined as follows:

```c
: strdupa macro (glibc/string/string.h)
# define strdupa(s)							   			\
  (__extension__							     		\
    ({									      			\
      const char *__old = (s);							\
      size_t __len = strlen (__old) + 1;				\
      char *__new = (char *) __builtin_alloca (__len);	\
      (char *) memcpy (__new, __old, __len);			\
    }))
```

<mark>__builtin_alloca</mark> is a gcc built-in function that can be set to be allocated on the `stack` instead of the `heap` when allocating dynamic variables.

So if you look at glibc's `strdupa` code, you can see that it doesn't call free().

Since it is not allocated on the heap like malloc(), its life-time becomes a `function block`.

Therefore, as with any local variable, without a separate free(), the effect of freeing can be exerted only by restoring the stack pointer to the caller function.

As a result, both `cpu-time` and `memory` have advantages over malloc.

<mark>__builtin_alloca</mark> is a function called by gcc at `compile-time`, not a function called by process at run-time.
It works like a macro, but not strictly a macro.

You can see that <mark>__builtin_alloca</mark> is converted to other code by gcc via disassemble.

```x86asm
: builtin_alloca was replaced to
void func(size_t n, const char* src) {
    ...
	char *val = (char *)__builtin_alloca(n);
 739:	48 8b 45 e8          	mov    -0x18(%rbp),%rax
 73d:	48 8d 50 0f          	lea    0xf(%rax),%rdx
 741:	b8 10 00 00 00       	mov    $0x10,%eax
 746:	48 83 e8 01          	sub    $0x1,%rax
 74a:	48 01 d0             	add    %rdx,%rax
 74d:	b9 10 00 00 00       	mov    $0x10,%ecx
 752:	ba 00 00 00 00       	mov    $0x0,%edx
 757:	48 f7 f1             	div    %rcx
 75a:	48 6b c0 10          	imul   $0x10,%rax,%rax
 75e:	48 29 c4             	sub    %rax,%rsp
 761:	48 89 e0             	mov    %rsp,%rax
 764:	48 83 c0 0f          	add    $0xf,%rax
 768:	48 c1 e8 04          	shr    $0x4,%rax
 76c:	48 c1 e0 04          	shl    $0x4,%rax
 770:	48 89 45 f0          	mov    %rax,-0x10(%rbp)

	memcpy(val, src, n);
	...
```
You can see that it is not in the form of a function call like `callq __builtin_alloca`

This builtin allocates a dynamic variable and is used where it is guaranteed to be used temporarily in a function, such as a local variable.

Let's take a look at the gcc documentation.

> #### Built-in Function: void *__builtin_alloca (size_t size)
> The `__builtin_alloca` function must be called at block scope<br>.
> The function allocates an object size bytes large on the stack of the calling function. The object is aligned on the default `stack` alignment boundary for the target determined by the __BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__ macro.<br>
> The __builtin_alloca function returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated object.
The lifetime of the allocated object ends just before the <b>calling function returns to its caller</b>.<br>

I haven't looked closely at the gcc code, but it's a builtin that has been around since gcc 2.8.

Let's easily check how to use it through the sample code.

```c
: sample code - alloca.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void func(const size_t n, const char* src) {
	char *val = (char *)__builtin_alloca(n);
	strncpy(val, src, n - 1);
	val[n - 1] = '\0';

	printf("val: %s\n", val);
}

int main(void) {
	func(4, "simple");

	return 0;
}
```
```bash
: gcc version 7.4.0 --target=x86_64-linux-gnu
$ gcc -g -o alloca alloca.c
$ ./alloca
val: sim
```

```x86asm
: assembly - x86_64 AT&T
void func(const size_t n, const char* src) {
 6fa:	55                   	push   %rbp
 6fb:	48 89 e5             	mov    %rsp,%rbp
 6fe:	48 83 ec 20          	sub    $0x20,%rsp
 702:	48 89 7d e8          	mov    %rdi,-0x18(%rbp)
 706:	48 89 75 e0          	mov    %rsi,-0x20(%rbp)
 70a:	64 48 8b 04 25 28 00 	mov    %fs:0x28,%rax
 711:	00 00 
 713:	48 89 45 f8          	mov    %rax,-0x8(%rbp)
 717:	31 c0                	xor    %eax,%eax
	char *val = (char *)__builtin_alloca(n);
 719:	48 8b 45 e8          	mov    -0x18(%rbp),%rax
 71d:	48 8d 50 0f          	lea    0xf(%rax),%rdx
 721:	b8 10 00 00 00       	mov    $0x10,%eax
 726:	48 83 e8 01          	sub    $0x1,%rax
 72a:	48 01 d0             	add    %rdx,%rax
 72d:	b9 10 00 00 00       	mov    $0x10,%ecx
 732:	ba 00 00 00 00       	mov    $0x0,%edx
 737:	48 f7 f1             	div    %rcx
 73a:	48 6b c0 10          	imul   $0x10,%rax,%rax
 73e:	48 29 c4             	sub    %rax,%rsp
 741:	48 89 e0             	mov    %rsp,%rax
 744:	48 83 c0 0f          	add    $0xf,%rax
 748:	48 c1 e8 04          	shr    $0x4,%rax
 74c:	48 c1 e0 04          	shl    $0x4,%rax
 750:	48 89 45 f0          	mov    %rax,-0x10(%rbp)
	strncpy(val, src, n);
 ...
 7a6:	c9                   	leaveq 
 7a7:	c3                   	retq   
```

The align routines were also added by the compiler, but the important part is that the stack size is just increased for variable allocation, and when the function returns, it simply `retq` without free().

The gcc documentation describes scope as follows:
> The lifetime of the allocated object ends just before the calling function returns to its caller

In glibc 1.09, <mark>__builtin_alloca</mark> was defined as <mark>alloca</mark> to shorten the long names.

```c
: __builtin_alloca is defined as alloca in glibc/stdlib/alloca.h
#ifdef	__GNUC__
# define alloca(size)	__builtin_alloca (size)
#endif /* GCC.  */
```
So if you include `alloca.h`, you can simply use `alloca`.

However, in my personal opinion, since gcc built-in is not a function called at run-time, but a function called by gcc at compile-time, I think it would be better to express the prefix <mark>__builtin</mark> as it is.

However, this is simply a matter of coding style, and if it is a multi-person project, you can make a promise (coding rules) about how to use it and use it.

It looks like ->[^1]VLA[/^] supported by C99, but the lifetime is different from VLA.

VLA litftime is block scope and <mark>alloca</mark> is function scope.
This means that the VLA cannot be used in the following situations:

```c
: It is impossible in VLA
#define COUNT 10

struct sample {
	unsigned char *p_x;
};

void func(void) {
	struct sample val[COUNT];
	int i;

	for (i = 0; i < COUNT; i++) {
		/* Use VLA */
		unsigned char x[i];
		/* unsigned char *x = (unsigned char *)__builtin_alloca(i); */
		memset(x, 0, i);

		val[i].p_x = x;
		/* The lifetime of x is terminated */
	}

	sumthing_to_do(val);

	return;
}
```

As mentioned above, many books and posts advise against using VLA or alloca that dynamically allocates variables on the stack because they are un-safe in terms of security, and I agree.
Code that dynamically allocates variables on the stack can cause a stack overflow, which can be a security hole.
And also, if a negative number is used for length, the code may flow in an entirely unintended direction.
And it can confuse people who don't know </mark>alloca</mark> because it's different from the alloc/free pairing commonly used for dynamic allocation in Standard C.
> alloca is not standard - it is a GNU extension

For the above reasons, the kernel project made a lot of effort to remove the VLA code, and as a result, it was completely successful in 4.20.

The GNU documentation describes the benefits of <mark>alloca</mark> as follows:

> #### Advantages-of-Alloca
> * Using alloca wastes very <b>little space</b> and is very <b>fast</b>. (It is open-coded by the GNU C compiler.)<br>
> * Since alloca does not have separate pools for different sizes of blocks, space used for any size block can be reused for any other size. alloca <b>does not cause memory fragmentation.</b><br>
> * Nonlocal exits done with longjmp (see Non-Local Exits) automatically free the space allocated with alloca when they exit through the function that called alloca. This is the most important reason to use alloca.

The disadvantages are described as follows.

> #### Disadvantages-of-Alloca
> * If you try to allocate more memory than the machine can provide, you donâ€™t get a clean error message. Instead you get a fatal signal like the one you would get from an infinite recursion; probably a segmentation violation (see Program Error Signals).<br>
> * Some non-GNU systems fail to support alloca, so it is less portable. However, a slower emulation of alloca written in C is available for use on systems with this deficiency.

`__builtin_alloca_with_align` was added in gcc 4.7 and `__builtin_alloca_with_align_and_max` was added in gcc 8.1.
Added to be able to set max_size or align to make <mark>alloca</mark> safer to use.

It's a simple addition. Check out the documentation.

> #### https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html<br>
> * Built-in Function: void *__builtin_alloca_with_align (size_t size, size_t alignment)<br>
> * Built-in Function: void *__builtin_alloca_with_align_and_max (size_t size, size_t alignment, size_t max_size)

To make <mark>alloca</mark> safer to use, gcc 7.0 has added a compile option that can check the max size of alloca at compile-time.
You can also check if <mark>alloca</mark> is used in your code at compile time.

These will be explained later in another post.
> -Walloca-larger-than, -Walloca ...

If you're going to use <mark>alloca</mark>, you'll need to pay attention to size and range checks.

Note that using <mark>alloca</mark> in an inline function may result in unintended behavior.
You can easily find out why if you google it :)
