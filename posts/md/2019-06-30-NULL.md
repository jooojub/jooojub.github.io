#### Environmets

 : assembly: AT&T

As you know <mark>NULL</mark> and <mark>0</mark> are not equal in GNU C
> NULL != 0

So what is <mark>NULL</mark>? Let's check it easily with a simple sample code.

```c
: sample source code - null.c
#include <stddef.h>

int main(void) {
	char *value = NULL;

	return 0;
}
```
```bash
: preprocess only
$ gcc -E null.c
```
```c
: result
# 1 "null.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 31 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 32 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "null.c"
# 1 "/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/include/stddef.h" 1 3 4
.....

# 3 "null.c"
int main(void) {
 char *value = 
# 4 "null.c" 3 4
	((void *)0) /* 0 == ((void *)0) */
...
}
```

As you can see from the result of the pre-process, <mark>NULL</mark> is replaced with <mark>((void *)0)</mark>.
> NULL == ((void *)0)

So what about including <cd>stdio.h</cd> instead of <cd>stddef.h</cd>?

```c
: include `stdio.h` instead of `stddef.h`
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	char *value = NULL;

	return 0;
}
```
```bash
: preprocess only
$ gcc -E null.c
```
```c
:result
# 4 "null.c"
int main(void) {
 char *value = 
# 5 "null.c" 3 4
	((void *)0)
...
}
```

The result is the same.

Because <mark>NULL</mark> is not defined in <cd>stdio.h</cd>, it just includes <cd>stddef.h</cd>.
If <mark>NULL</mark> had been defined in <cd>stdio.h</cd>, it would have been re-defined by <cd>stddef.h</cd>.

```c
: `stddef.h` is also included by `stdio.h`
# 1 "null.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 31 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 32 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "null.c"

# 1 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 1 3 4
...
# 1 "/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/include/stddef.h" 1 3 4
...
```

```c
: content of stdio.h
#define __need_size_t
#define __need_NULL
#include <stddef.h>
...
```

Looking at gcc's <cd>stddef.h</cd>, <mark>NULL</mark> is defined as follows.

```c
: NULL definition in `stddef.h`
/* A null pointer constant.  */

#if defined (_STDDEF_H) || defined (__need_NULL)
#undef NULL		/* in case <stdio.h> has defined it. */
#ifdef __GNUG__
#define NULL __null
#else   /* G++ */
#ifndef __cplusplus
#define NULL ((void *)0)
#else   /* C++ */
#define NULL 0
#endif  /* C++ */
#endif  /* G++ */
#endif	/* NULL not defined and <stddef.h> or need NULL.  */
#undef	__need_NULL
```

In the ->[^1] GNU C++ compiler[/^], <mark>NULL</mark> is defined as <cd>__null</cd>, and in ->[^2] C++[/^], it is defined as <cd>0</cd>.

```bash
: build with GNU C++
$ g++ -E null.c
```

```c
: result with GNU C++
# 4 "null.c"
int main(void) {
 char *value = 
# 5 "null.c" 3 4
	__null
...
```

If so, does using `NULL` instead of 0 or 0 instead of `NULL` cause problems?

The most important difference between 0 and NULL is that `0` is <mark>int</mark> and `NULL` is <mark>void *</mark>.

In other words, on a 64-bit machine, the size of 0 and NULL will be different.

```c
: sizeof NULL in 64-bit
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	printf("sizeof(0): %lu, sizeof(NULL): %lu\n", sizeof(0), sizeof(NULL));

	return 0;
}
```
```c
: size of result
sizeof(0): 4, sizeof(NULL): 8
```

So, putting 0 where you expect <mark>NULL</mark> can cause problems because the sizes are different.

This problem is easily seen where you use variable-length argument like,
> va_arg (val, *)

```c
: problem examples when put 0 not NULL
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

int expect(const char *fmt, ...) {
	va_list ap;
	char *val;

	va_start(ap, fmt);

	while (val = va_arg(ap, char *))
		printf("value: %s\n", val);

	va_end(ap);

	return 0;
}

int main(void) {
  /* because of x86-64bit calling convention,
        passed many arguments for reproduction. */
	expect("aaa", "bbb", "ccc", "ddd", "fff", "ggg", "hhh", "iii", 0);

	return 0;
}
```


expect() function expects a `char*` pointer as `va argument`.
So it will pop an 8-byte from the stack, and if you put a `0` instead of <mark>NULL</mark>, you'll get a 4-byte stack overflow.

```bash
: compile with gcc-4
$ gcc-4.8 -o null null.c
```
```bash
: result
value: bbb
value: ccc
value: ddd
value: fff
value: ggg
value: hhh
value: iii
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
```c
: change to
//expect("aaa", "bbb", "ccc", "ddd", "fff", "ggg", "hhh", "iii", 0);
expect("aaa", "bbb", "ccc", "ddd", "fff", "ggg", "hhh", "iii", NULL);
```
```bash
: result
value: bbb
value: ccc
value: ddd
value: fff
value: ggg
value: hhh
value: iii
```
For reference, the above code will not reproduce the problem in gcc-7 or higher.
Looking at the code of gcc-7, when passing an argument, it is compiled to use `pushq` instead of `push`.
gcc is getting smarter.

```x86asm
...
7d9:	6a 00                	pushq  $0x0
7db:	48 8d 05 f5 00 00 00 	lea    0xf5(%rip),%rax        # 8d7 
...
```

If you look at the man pages of execl-like functions, it is emphasized to use <mark>NULL</mark> instead of 0.

> #### man execl
> The const char *arg and subsequent ellipses in the execl(), execlp(), and execle() functions can be thought of as arg0, arg1, ..., argn.<br>
> Together they describe a list of one or more pointers to <b>null-terminated</b> strings that represent the argument list available to the executed program.<br>
> The first argument, by convention, should point to the filename associated with the file being executed.
> The list of arguments must be terminated by a <mark>null pointer</mark>, and, since these are variadic functions, this pointer must be <mark>cast (char *) NULL</mark>.

Take a look at the code in glibc's execl to see why.
The execl function uses <mark>NULL</mark> to know the number of argc.

```c
: glibc/posix/execl.c
/* Execute PATH with all arguments after PATH until
   a NULL pointer and environment from `environ'.  */
int
execl (const char *path, const char *arg, ...)
{
  ptrdiff_t argc;
  va_list ap;
  va_start (ap, arg);
  for (argc = 1; va_arg (ap, const char *); argc++)
    {
      if (argc == INT_MAX)
	{
	  va_end (ap);
	  errno = E2BIG;
	  return -1;
	}
    }
  va_end (ap);
....
```
In conclusion, you should always recognize that <mark>NULL != 0</mark> and avoid using them interchangeably.
